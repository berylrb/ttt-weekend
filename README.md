# Tic-Tac-Grow
This is the first in a series of simple JavaScript games I'm building to expand and solidify my JS knowledge. 



This fun take on a classic game was built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation


This game features custom animations and illustrations, as well as confetti animation from <a href="https://github.com/Agezao/confetti-js">this repo</a>. 


## Icebox:
Features I'm planning to implement in the future:

* [ ] - fix the css --> this was one of the first projects I ever built, and I wrestled with the CSS for way too long. Now I have a much better understanding of how and why to use various styling rules, and I have big plans to revamp the CSS to be more effective and more logical (remove a lot of brute force styling rules and make sure everything fits properly). 
* [ ] - mobile optimization and/or varying board sizes.
* [ ] - add a dummy oponent that plays against the user.
